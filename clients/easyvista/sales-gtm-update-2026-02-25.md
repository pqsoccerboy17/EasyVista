# Sales & GTM Update -- Feb 25, 2026
## For CEO/COO Project Update Meeting

### LEMLIST -- Outbound Automation (BDR Teams)

- **Status:** US pilot live as of Feb 20; Enterprise plan (10 seats) signed by Evan
- Lemlist AM (Esteban) onboarded -- trilingual (EN/FR/ES), provided full Notion onboarding site with team lead checklists
- Lemlist x HubSpot integration coordinated with Alessio De Santis and Chris Hult -- Alessio confirmed "straightforward," meeting scheduled to finalize; Chris confirmed minimal Salesforce pass-through work
- **Training this week (MANDATORY):**
  - ~~Feb 26 -- French BDR session~~ **PUSHED TO NEXT WEEK** -- Laure Ruperas and Raphael Hugnet both OOO until Mar 2; rescheduling to week of Mar 2
  - Feb 27 -- English BDR session (Tim Brouillard, Sean Herbert, Stefano, Alessio, Ismael)
  - Separate DACH session sent to Christopher Kuhn + Seima Ishaq (Kuhn added Ishaq to training)
- **Go/No-Go decision: Mar 7** after 2-week pilot monitoring
- **Evan's target: 30%+ increase in BDR opp creation** (from ~15-20 to 25-30 opps/quarter), no added headcount
- Germany excluded from initial scope (works council constraints; Christopher Kuhn informed)

### LOOPIO -- RFP/Presales Knowledge Management

- **Status:** Library fully imported -- Yann confirmed technical/functional content + general info/security all translated to English and loaded into Loopio (completed 3 days early via Smartcat)
- Dalila confirmed: two training sessions with Todd completed, NAM team now attending and "much more comfortable"
- **First RFP completed in Loopio:** Todd Russell ran the Mohawk RFP end-to-end -- believes it will vastly reduce turnaround time (prior 3-day RFP reduced to ~1 day)
- Office hours launched with Dalila/Yann for ongoing enablement
- **Upcoming:** US pre-sales training Feb 28, France training Mar 14, global complete by Mar 21
- NAM adoption was at zero prior to Feb 4 mandatory alignment call -- knowledge/language gap resolved; Rod's workflow preference (ChatGPT) addressed via 1:1 interview
- Gartner RFP format issue resolved -- can't import into Loopio but only 1-2% of annual volume; manual qualification process in place
- **Target:** 100% global adoption by Mar 31

### KEY RISKS & MITIGATIONS

- **French Lemlist training pushed to next week** -- Laure and Raphael both OOO until Mar 2; original Feb 26 session rescheduled. Compresses timeline ahead of Mar 7 Go/No-Go. Cedric's involvement is critical ("needs to be France's idea")
- **Integration timeline** -- HubSpot-to-Salesforce connector needs to be live before training; Alessio/Chris meeting this week to finalize
- **Individual tool preference divergence** -- Rod (ChatGPT), Sean (custom GPT for RFPs) -- workflow interviews completed, tailored enablement in place
- **Timeline to Mar 31 deadline** -- Weekly tracking cadence with Evan escalation path; Evan pushing aggressively on both workstreams
