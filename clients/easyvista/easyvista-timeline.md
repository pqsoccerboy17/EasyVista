## Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Individual tool preference divergence | confirmed | medium | Workflow interview to understand requirements; address root cause with tailored enablement |
| Europe adoption resistance | high | high | Henry involvement; regional positioning; engage Cedric and regional BDR leads early via dedicated French training session |
| Germany works council | n/a | n/a | Excluded from initial scope; Christopher informed |
| Stakeholder non-response | medium | high | Follow-up cadence; Evan escalation path if needed |
| Q1 timeline slip | medium | high | Weekly tracking; early escalation; buffer in schedule |
| Loopio multi-language limitation | confirmed | medium | Mike researching solutions for content synchronization; workaround with separate language instances |
| Laure Ruperas and Raphael Hugnet missed French training (OOO until Mar 2) | resolved | low | French training completed Feb 26 as planned. Additional follow-up session week of Mar 2 for Laure + Raphael when they return. |
