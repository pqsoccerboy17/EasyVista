# Eurazeo AI Hackathon — Consolidated Working Notes

**Last updated:** Feb 23, 2026
**Sources:** Russell's email (Feb 19), Henry's notes (Feb 23), Granola meeting transcript (Feb 12), email thread with Guillaume/Gurvan
**Follow-up meeting:** Scheduled ~Feb 25 at 15:00 CET

## What Eurazeo Wants (Their Two Goals)

1. **Accelerate AI adoption** across the portfolio — inspire CEOs to move from talking to doing, show AI is achievable even for smaller companies
2. **Demonstrate platform value** to portfolio companies and LPs — create a fundraising/LP communication asset, answer the "is SaaS dead?" question

---

## Where We All Agree

- **Focus area leaning → Product / new AI capabilities** (option 1). Guillaume, Russell, and the broader group shifted toward this for the stronger "wow factor," better LP storytelling, and revenue impact potential.
- **In-person strongly preferred** — cross-portfolio networking, energy, lasting relationships
- **24-hour intensive format** (literally overnight, Tue or Wed)
- **~2-month planning cycle** from decision to event; avoid quarter-ends → May or October preferred
- **Companies submit project proposals** describing pain points, expected ROI, learning objectives; requires CEO approval
- **Partner support** from AWS, Azure, OpenAI, or tool vendors → coaching, free credits, software seats, swag
- **Post-event tracking at 90 and 180 days** is a critical success factor
- **Film the event** with video crews for investor materials / LP communications
- **Charge portfolio companies a small fee** to ensure commitment and offset costs

---

## Participant Scale — Resolved

**Decision: 30–50 total participants.** This aligns with Russell's notes and the original meeting discussion. Henry had relayed a larger number from Gurvan (30 companies × 5 = 150), but we are planning for the 30–50 range, which translates to roughly 8–12 companies with 4–5 per team.

Budget tiers have been updated accordingly in the Word proposal (Gold ~€55–95K, Silver ~€30–55K, Lean ~€10–20K).

## What Henry Says the Proposal Needs (The Gaps)

Henry's notes are the clearest articulation of what needs to be sharpened. He acknowledges overlap with Russell but calls out four specific areas:

### 1. More Concrete Budget & Structure
- Tighter cost range (with/without travel & hotels, for 150 people)
- **Gold / Silver / Lean** event tiers — let Eurazeo choose their investment level
- Clear delineation: what Yelin.io delivers vs. what vendors/partners provide

### 2. Sharper Proposal on Focus
- Recommend a primary focus (likely product/new AI capabilities) and articulate **why**
- Address whether engineering and GTMT can still be involved without diluting the product story — or if they should be excluded
- Include an example deliverable: "In 24h, a team could ship X and demo Y"

### 3. Operational Model
- How companies apply (proposal form, approval criteria)
- Who participates per team (roles) and what prep they must do beforehand
- How success is measured: portfolio AI maturity before/after, follow-up at 90/180 days

### 4. LP / Platform Value Story
- How the hackathon directly supports Eurazeo's two goals (AI adoption + platform value)
- Content capture plan: videos, case studies — what 3rd-party support is needed to produce LP-grade materials

## Russell's Detailed Notes (Structured Summary)

### Focus Options Discussed
1. **Build new AI products/capabilities** ← LEADING. Works for SaaS and services. Guillaume + Russell advocated for this.
2. **AI tools in engineering/R&D** — deepening developer AI adoption. Skews toward SaaS companies.
3. **AI tools for go-to-market** — Guillaume's initial preference. Includes services companies.

Russell's unique contribution: value of **combining all three** to break down organizational silos between product, engineering, and GTM teams.

### Hackathon Approach
- Companies submit proposals: customer/internal pain points, expected ROI, learning objectives → CEO approval required
- Rapid experimentation in risk-constrained environment
- Projects could involve building new features OR testing third-party tools (e.g., Lemlist)
- Some companies could start prep work before the event to maximize progress

### Partner & Resource Support
- Technical experts from AWS, Azure, OpenAI, or tool vendors for coaching + best practices
- Partners typically provide free credits, software seats, swag
- Tools should enable quick free/low-cost experimentation during the 24-hour window

### Outstanding Decisions (from Russell)
- Finalize focus area
- Determine specific timeline (avoid quarter-ends)
- Awards/prizes structure
- Confirm third-party vendor partnerships
- Assess portfolio company homogeneity requirements

## Signals from the Email Thread

- **Guillaume agreed to a follow-up meeting** (Feb 17) — Géraldine Pouilly coordinating
- **Follow-up scheduled** for ~Feb 25 at 15:00 CET
- **Key Eurazeo contacts:** Guillaume de Montchalin (Partner, Elevate), Gurvan Rallon, Florent Melis, Clément Morin (cc)
- **Guillaume needs internal budget alignment** — this requires reallocation since past budget discussions
- **Partner availability is on the critical path** for timeline

## Open Questions for the Follow-Up

1. **Focus scope:** Pure product focus, or a hybrid that allows engineering/GTM tracks as secondary?
3. **Location:** Paris? Eurazeo HQ area? Or somewhere neutral?
4. **Yelin.io scope of work:** What exactly is our engagement — program design only? End-to-end event management? Day-of facilitation + coaching?
5. **Budget ownership:** Is Eurazeo funding this directly, or are we proposing a fee structure?
6. **Awards/prizes:** What's the incentive structure? Judging criteria?
7. **Content production:** Is Eurazeo handling video/case study production, or is that in our scope?
