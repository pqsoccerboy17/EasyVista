Subject: Agenda - Weekly Sync (Thu 2/12)

Hi Evan,

Quick agenda for our sync tomorrow:

1. Lemlist Procurement - Quote sent over for your signature today (Chris is copied). Need to close this week to hit our Feb 20 pilot launch.

2. BDR Rollout Readiness - Status check on office hours scheduling with regional managers + sharing the adoption guide with BDR leadership. I'll have updates on the email template and ROI calculator.

3. Loopio Translation (Due Fri 2/13) - Any visibility on John/Todd progress with the English library? Need to plan the import and training sessions once it lands.

4. AirOps / AEO Prep - We have the broader group call at 1 PM CT with Patrice, Enrique, and G. Romeo. Worth aligning on our positioning before that one, especially around current AEO traffic vs. investment timing.

Talk tomorrow,
Mike
