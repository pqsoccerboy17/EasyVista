# Writing Style Preferences

> Guide for email drafts, documents, and written output.

## Em Dash Rule

**Writing Style Rule:** Never use em dashes ("—") in any drafts, emails, or written output. This is a major red flag that signals AI-generated content. Use alternatives like commas, periods, colons, or parentheses instead.

### Examples

**DON'T:**
- "We need to review the proposal — it's due tomorrow."

**DO:**
- "We need to review the proposal. It's due tomorrow."
- "We need to review the proposal: it's due tomorrow."
- "We need to review the proposal (it's due tomorrow)."
