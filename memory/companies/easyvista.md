---

## Qualification

### Positive Signals
1. **PE-backed with growth mandate** — Eurazeo PME majority since 2020; tripled recurring revenue; €100M ARR target
2. **Active GTM transformation** — 3 new sales VPs in 12 months; new CMO; Lemlist + Loopio + HubSpot rollouts
3. **AI-first repositioning** — Rebranded as "AI-Powered ITSM"; LLM automation, virtual agents, self-healing
4. **Aggressive M&A** — 7 acquisitions including $24.5M OTRS deal; European consolidation play
5. **Decision-maker access confirmed** — Direct COO relationship, active C-suite engagement

### Caution Signals
1. **Complex multinational structure** — France HQ + 11 offices; Germany works council constraints
2. **Cultural adoption challenges** — France needs to feel tools are "France's idea"; some prefer ChatGPT over Loopio
3. **Revenue team of one** — Chris Hult runs RevOps solo; bandwidth constraint

### Unknown Gaps
1. **Post-OTRS integration status** — Product/team integration progress unclear
2. **AI maturity depth** — Marketing says "AI-powered" but unclear how deep vs. surface features

### ICP Scorecard
| Criterion | Score | Note |
|-----------|-------|------|
| PE-backed | 5/5 | Eurazeo PME + Cathay Capital + Momentum Invest |
| Revenue range | 4/5 | Est. $25M-$75M (target €100M ARR) |
| GTM transformation | 5/5 | Active Lemlist, Loopio, HubSpot + 3 new sales leaders |
| Decision-maker access | 5/5 | Weekly COO relationship, full C-suite engagement |
| **Overall** | **4.75/5** | **Strong Fit** |

**Recommended Action:** Strong fit — active client engagement. Continue driving Lemlist/Loopio/Tech DD workstreams toward Mar 7 Go/No-Go milestone.

---

## Approach

### Entry Points
1. **Evan Carlson (COO)** — Primary sponsor with weekly 1:1s. Strategic escalation and Go/No-Go decision alignment.
2. **Patrice Barbedette (CEO)** — Board-level visibility. Tech DD findings and AI readiness narrative for PE investors.
3. **Chris Hult (VP RevOps)** — Operational owner of Lemlist + NetSuite. Day-to-day execution and HubSpot integration.
4. **Dalila Souiah (Head of Presales)** — Co-leads Loopio adoption. Critical for global presales team buy-in.

### Opening Hooks
1. "OTRS gives you 850+ new clients in DACH — the Lemlist outbound infrastructure will be the engine that cross-sells into that base."
2. "With 3 new VP Sales hires in 12 months, tool standardization (Lemlist + Loopio + HubSpot) will give them a fighting chance to hit targets."
3. "The €100M ARR target requires scaling outbound at 2-3x current velocity. Lemlist automation is the force multiplier."

### Discovery Questions
1. "How is the OTRS team integration progressing? Are DACH BDRs included in Lemlist rollout scope?"
2. "What does the Mar 7 Go/No-Go decision hinge on? What metrics need to be hit?"
3. "How is the French presales team responding to Loopio? Resistance signals from Cédric's org?"
4. "Status of the AI readiness assessment for the PE investor narrative?"
