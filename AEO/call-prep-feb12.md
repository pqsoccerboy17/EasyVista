## AEO in 30 Seconds

Answer Engine Optimization is about making your content show up when people ask AI tools (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews) questions about your industry. Traditional SEO gets you ranked in Google search results. AEO gets your brand cited in AI-generated answers. Gartner predicts traditional search volume drops 25% by 2026 as AI answers grow, so this matters.

## The Real Comparison: AirOps vs Jasper vs Free AI

| | AirOps ($20K/yr) | Jasper ($20K+/yr) | Free AI (ChatGPT/Claude) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Content generation | Yes | Yes (its main strength) | Yes, 80% as good |
| Workflow automation | Yes (its main strength) | No | No (manual process) |
| Brand voice templates | Yes | Yes | DIY with custom prompts |
| SEO/AEO insights | Built-in | Limited | Manual research |
| AEO visibility tracking | No | No | No |
| Custom data pipelines | Yes | No | No |
| Team collaboration | Yes | Yes | Limited |

**Key takeaway:** Neither AirOps nor Jasper actually tracks whether AI engines cite EasyVista. They both help create content. The tracking question is a separate tool category entirely (Profound, SE Visible, etc. starting at $99/mo).

## The Two Sides You'll Hear

**Enrico's likely case (pro-AirOps):**
- We already have a POC and live workflows in AirOps
- Switching costs are real if we abandon it now
- Jasper is just a writing tool, AirOps is infrastructure
- We need to scale content production for AEO

**Evan's likely concern (skeptical):**
- ChatGPT and Claude can write the same content for free
- $20K/yr is significant when we're already budget-conscious
- 80% of leads are inbound already, why optimize what's working?
- What's the measurable ROI from the existing POC?

**What neither side may realize:**
- AEO tracking (knowing if AI cites you) requires different tools than content creation
- The PDF compares AirOps to Jasper, but the real question is AirOps vs. free AI tools
- Entry-level AEO tracking starts at $99/mo, not $20K/yr
- 99% of URLs cited by AI also rank in the top 20 organic results, meaning foundational SEO matters more than tooling

## Your 5 Facilitator Questions

Use these to steer the conversation toward clarity without taking sides:

1. **"What does success look like in 90 days?"**
   Why: Forces the group to define measurable criteria before spending. If they can't answer this, they're not ready to commit $20K.

2. **"What have we gotten from the AirOps POC so far that we couldn't get from ChatGPT?"**
   Why: Tests whether the existing investment has proven unique value. If the answer is vague, that's data.

3. **"If we paused AirOps for 60 days and used free tools, what specifically would we lose?"**
   Why: Separates real dependency from habit. If the answer is "nothing critical," the urgency isn't there.

4. **"Enrico, what's the one metric this needs to move?"**
   Why: Pins the champion to accountability. Good answers: "increase AI citations by X%," "produce Y pieces of optimized content per month." Bad answer: "improve our content strategy."

5. **"Are we solving a content creation problem or a measurement problem? Those are different budgets."**
   Why: Reframes the entire conversation. AirOps solves creation/automation. AEO tracking solves measurement. Conflating them leads to the wrong purchase.

## AEO Tool Pricing Cheat Sheet (if the conversation goes there)

| Budget | Tool | Monthly Cost | What It Does |
|---|---|---|---|
| Free | ChatGPT, Claude | $0 | Content creation, manual AEO testing |
| Entry | SE Visible, Peec AI | $99-200/mo | Track 100-200 prompts across AI engines |
| Mid | Goodie AI, Otterly | $300-500/mo | Competitive benchmarking, sentiment tracking |
| Enterprise | Profound, BrightEdge | $500-2,000+/mo | Full visibility tracking, GA4 integration, ROI proof |
| Automation | AirOps | ~$1,667/mo ($20K/yr) | Workflow automation, content pipelines, not tracking |

---

## Risk Flags (Frame as Questions)

- **Sunk cost:** "We've invested in the POC" is not a reason to commit $20K. Ask: "What's the ROI been so far?"
- **No kill switch:** Ask: "Can we structure this as a 90-day pilot instead of an annual contract?"
- **No measurement plan:** The PDF doesn't mention how they'll measure success. Ask: "How will we know this is working?"
- **Scope confusion:** AirOps is a content/automation tool, not an AEO tracking tool. If the goal is AEO visibility, AirOps alone won't tell them if it's working.

## Your Posture

You're the consultant who makes sure the right questions get asked before money gets spent. You're not anti-AirOps or pro-AirOps. You're pro-clarity.

If pressed for an opinion: "I think AEO is real and EasyVista should invest in it. The question is whether $20K on AirOps is the right first step, or whether we validate with cheaper tools first and then scale up if the data supports it."
