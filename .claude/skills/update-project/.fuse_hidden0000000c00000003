# EasyVista Project Update — Full Sync Workflow

You are performing a complete project status update for the EasyVista consulting engagement. This is Mike Duncan's (michael@yelin.io) Q1 2026 engagement with EasyVista, tracked via a config-driven static timeline.

The goal: pull context from every connected data source, update the single source of truth (config.json), regenerate all derivative artifacts, ensure the customer-facing site doesn't over-share, alert on stale stakeholders, and deploy everywhere.

## Before You Start

Read these reference files for tool names and sanitization patterns:
- `references/data-sources.md` (in this skill directory) — MCP tool names and search parameters
- `references/sanitization-rules.md` (in this skill directory) — customer-facing content rules

Read the project's CLAUDE.md for the current key people, architecture, and update workflow:
- Read the CLAUDE.md at the root of the EasyVista project directory

## Phase 1: Data Gathering

Run ALL of these searches in parallel. Cast a wide net — it's better to over-fetch than miss something.

### 1a. Outlook Email — Inbox (last 7 days)
Search for "EasyVista" in Inbox using `mcp__f94d56e9-d249-4ef1-ad10-6e9f2088b48b__outlook_email_search`:
- `query`: "EasyVista"
- `afterDateTime`: 7 days ago
- `limit`: 20

### 1b. Outlook Email — Sent Items (last 7 days)
Same search but in Sent Items. Mike's sent emails often contain critical decisions:
- `query`: "EasyVista"
- `afterDateTime`: 7 days ago
- `folderName`: "Sent Items"
- `limit`: 15

### 1c. Outlook Calendar — Upcoming meetings (next 30 days)
Search for EasyVista meetings using `mcp__f94d56e9-d249-4ef1-ad10-6e9f2088b48b__outlook_calendar_search`:
- `query`: "EasyVista OR Yelin OR Lemlist OR Loopio"
- `afterDateTime`: today
- `beforeDateTime`: 30 days from now
- `limit`: 20

### 1d. Notion — Granola Notes (last 7 days)
Search Notion using `mcp__3c554394-ee46-4ae8-9550-f341b3cad2c8__notion-search`:
- `query`: "EasyVista Granola Notes"
- `query_type`: "internal"
- `filters`: created_date_range with start_date = 7 days ago
For each result, use `notion-fetch` to pull the full meeting note content.

### 1e. MS Teams Chat (last 7 days)
Search Teams using `mcp__f94d56e9-d249-4ef1-ad10-6e9f2088b48b__chat_message_search`:
- `query`: "EasyVista"
- `afterDateTime`: 7 days ago
- `limit`: 15

### 1f. Current State
Read the current `config.json` from the project root. Note the `meta.last_updated` timestamp — everything since that date is new context.

## Phase 2: Analysis & Change Set

Compare gathered data against config.json and build a structured change set. Look for:

### Milestones
- New events that should be tracked (meetings that happened, decisions made, deliverables completed)
- Existing milestones that can now be marked `"complete": true`
- Upcoming meetings from calendar that should be added

### Task Status Updates
- Tasks in workstream phases that have been completed (evidence from email/notes)
- Tasks with shifted due dates
- New tasks that emerged from recent conversations

### Stakeholder Status Changes
The 5-state model: `cold` → `outreach_sent` → `scheduled` → `engaged` → `risk`
- Who was contacted since last update? (outreach_sent → scheduled or engaged)
- Who responded or attended meetings? (→ engaged)
- Any new stakeholders mentioned in emails/notes?
- Anyone showing resistance? (→ risk, but phrase diplomatically)

### Risks & Open Questions
- New risks identified in conversations
- Open questions that got resolved (prefix with "RESOLVED:")
- New open questions raised

### Present Change Set to User
Before editing any files, present a concise summary:
```
## Proposed Updates
**Milestones:** [list new/completed]
**Tasks:** [list status changes]
**Stakeholders:** [list status changes]
**Risks:** [new/resolved]
**Open Questions:** [new/resolved]

Proceed with these updates?
```
Wait for user confirmation. If they want changes, adjust before proceeding.

## Phase 3: Update config.json

Apply the confirmed change set to config.json:
1. Update `meta.last_updated` to current ISO timestamp
2. Apply all milestone additions/completions
3. Apply all task status updates
4. Apply all stakeholder status changes and notes
5. Apply risk and open question changes
6. Validate JSON is well-formed after editing

Only edit config.json — never edit derivative files directly.

## Phase 4: Regenerate & Sanitize

### Regenerate
Run the generator:
```bash
python3 generate_timeline.py
```
This updates: easyvista-gantt.mermaid, easyvista-stakeholders.mermaid, easyvista-timeline.md, and index.html (Mermaid diagrams + progress stats).

### Sanitize Customer-Facing Content
The generator only updates some sections of index.html. Hardcoded HTML sections may still contain sensitive content. Run a sweep across ALL output files:

```bash
grep -n "PATTERN" config.json index.html easyvista-timeline.md easyvista-gantt.mermaid easyvista-stakeholders.mermaid
```

See `references/sanitization-rules.md` for the full pattern list. The key categories:
- **Pricing/budget specifics**: Dollar amounts, specific contract terms
- **Individual names in negative context**: "X bypassing Y", "X refusing to use Y"
- **Internal strategy language**: "investor narrative", "capital raise", "fundraising"
- **Shadow IT references**: "using ChatGPT instead of", "100x/day"
- **Consultant-internal notes**: Budget gauges, stretch targets

For each match:
- If it's in config.json: rewrite the note diplomatically (config.json is not customer-facing, but feeds the generator)
- If it's in index.html hardcoded sections: edit directly with neutral language
- If it's in generated files: fix in config.json, re-run generator

## Phase 5: Stale Stakeholder Alerts

For each stakeholder in config.json, determine last known interaction:
1. Check stakeholder notes for dates mentioned
2. Cross-reference with recent email/calendar data from Phase 1
3. Check if any upcoming meetings are booked with them

Flag stakeholders who meet ANY of these criteria:
- No email/calendar interaction found in last 7 days AND status is "engaged" or "scheduled"
- Status is "outreach_sent" for more than 5 business days with no response
- Status is "cold" and they're in an active workstream

Output a prioritized follow-up list:
```
## Stale Stakeholder Alerts
🔴 [Name] — [Role] — Last contact: [date] — No upcoming meetings
   Suggested action: [specific follow-up recommendation]
🟡 [Name] — [Role] — Last contact: [date] — Meeting booked [date]
   Suggested action: [prep recommendation]
```

## Phase 6: Sync & Deploy

### 6a. Notion Sync
Search Notion for the EasyVista project page. If found, update it with a brief status summary including:
- Current phase for each workstream
- Tasks completed / total
- Stakeholders engaged / total
- Days to deadline
- Key upcoming milestones

### 6b. Git Commit
Stage all modified files and commit:
```bash
git add config.json easyvista-gantt.mermaid easyvista-stakeholders.mermaid easyvista-timeline.md index.html
git commit -m "update: [date] project status sync

[2-3 line summary of key changes]

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

### 6c. Git Push
Push to both remotes:
```bash
git push origin main && git push production main
```

If push fails (SSH key issues, permission denied), don't panic. Output the exact commands Mike needs to run from his local terminal:
```
The commit is saved locally. Run this from your terminal:
cd ~/Projects/EasyVista && git push origin main && git push production main
```

### 6d. Final Summary
Present a concise update report:
- What changed (milestone count, task completions, stakeholder moves)
- Stale stakeholder alerts (from Phase 5)
- Upcoming critical dates
- Any items that need Mike's attention

## Important Reminders
- config.json is the ONLY file you edit directly — everything else is generated
- Always search Sent Items in Outlook — Mike's decisions live there
- Granola Notes are in Notion, not email — don't confuse the sources
- The customer-facing site (GitHub Pages) is visible to Evan, Patrice, and other EasyVista stakeholders — be mindful of what goes on it
- Mike is not a developer — run all git commands for him, don't just show them
