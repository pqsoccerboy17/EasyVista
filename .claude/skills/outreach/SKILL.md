# /outreach — Unified Outreach Drafting

## Objective
Research a prospect then draft personalized outreach — email, LinkedIn, or multi-touch sequence. Consolidates: draft-outreach, email-sequences, linkedin-engagement.

## Step 1: Gather Context (parallel)
Before writing anything, pull ALL available context:
- **Notion Stakeholders DB** — Existing record, relationship strength, past interactions
- **Outlook email** — Any prior correspondence (check both inbox AND sent)
- **Granola Notes** — Any meeting notes mentioning this person
- **Clay enrichment** — If available, pull work history, recent activity
- **Web search** — Recent publications, LinkedIn posts, company news

## Step 2: Determine Outreach Type
Based on context and Mike's request:
- **Cold outreach** — No prior relationship. Lead with relevance, not rapport.
- **Warm follow-up** — Prior meeting or introduction. Reference specific shared context.
- **Re-engagement** — Gone silent. Acknowledge the gap, bring fresh value.
- **Multi-touch sequence** — Series of 3-5 emails over 2-3 weeks.
- **LinkedIn message** — Short, conversational, <300 characters for connection requests.

## Step 3: Draft the Message(s)

### Style Rules (Mike's voice):
- **Concise** — Get to the point. No filler paragraphs.
- **Conversational** — Write like a peer, not a salesperson.
- **Specific** — Reference something real about them or their company.
- **One clear ask** — Every message ends with one action (not three).
- **No jargon** — Skip "synergy", "leverage", "circle back". Just talk normally.

### For Email:
- Subject line: Short, specific, no clickbait
- Body: 3-5 sentences max for cold outreach, can be longer for warm
- Sign-off: "Best, Mike" (keep it simple)

### For LinkedIn:
- Connection request: <300 chars, mention mutual connection or specific relevance
- Follow-up message: 2-3 sentences, link to something valuable

### For Multi-Touch Sequence:
- Email 1 (Day 1): Value-first intro, specific relevance
- Email 2 (Day 3-4): Different angle, share a resource or insight
- Email 3 (Day 7-8): Social proof or case study reference
- Email 4 (Day 12-14): Break-up email, leave the door open
- Each email should stand alone — don't assume they read the previous ones

## Step 4: Present for Review
- Show the draft(s) clearly formatted
- Note the channel (email/LinkedIn) and any timing recommendations
- If sequence: show all emails with suggested send dates
- Ask: "Want me to adjust the tone, add anything, or send?"

## Constraints
- Never send without Mike's explicit approval
- Always check for existing relationship context before defaulting to cold outreach
- If the person is in the Stakeholders DB, reference their relationship strength to calibrate tone
- Match the language to the recipient's region (English for US/UK, note if French/German/Spanish contact)
